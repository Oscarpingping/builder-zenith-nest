# Backend Connectivity Fix

## Issues Identified
The "Failed to fetch" errors are occurring because:

1. **Browser Security/CORS Issues**: Fetch requests are being blocked or timing out
2. **Missing Database Tables**: The `saved_activities` table doesn't exist in the database
3. **Timeout Issues**: Using incompatible timeout methods

## Fixes Applied

### 1. API Service Timeout Fix
- ✅ Replaced `AbortSignal.timeout()` with cross-browser compatible timeout using `AbortController`
- ✅ Added better error handling for network failures
- ✅ Improved graceful fallback to demo mode

### 2. AuthContext Improvements
- ✅ Added timeout handling for profile fetching
- ✅ Added fallback profile creation when API is unavailable
- ✅ Better error logging and recovery

### 3. Database Schema Fix Required
The `saved_activities` table needs to be created in your Supabase database.

**To fix this, run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Create saved_activities table if it doesn't exist
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS saved_activities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  activity_id UUID REFERENCES activities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  saved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Unique constraint to prevent duplicate saves
  UNIQUE(user_id, activity_id)
);

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_saved_activities_user ON saved_activities(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_saved_activities_activity ON saved_activities(activity_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_saved_activities_saved_at ON saved_activities(saved_at);

-- Enable RLS for saved activities
ALTER TABLE saved_activities ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own saved activities" ON saved_activities;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can save activities" ON saved_activities;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can unsave activities" ON saved_activities;

-- Saved activities policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own saved activities" ON saved_activities 
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can save activities" ON saved_activities 
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can unsave activities" ON saved_activities 
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Frontend error handling improved
- ✅ Timeout issues fixed
- ✅ Graceful fallback to demo mode implemented
- ⚠️ Database migration needed (run SQL above)

## Testing
After applying the database fix, the app should:
1. Successfully connect to backend APIs
2. Load real data from database
3. Fall back gracefully to demo mode if backend is unavailable
4. Display user profiles and saved activities correctly

The fetch errors should be resolved once the database schema is complete and the improved error handling is in place.
